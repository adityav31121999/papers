This repository hold some of my works that I have done out of curiosity and my interest.
This includes mathematics, physics and computer sciences.
For mathematical work, these are pretty diverse.
For physics, is is mostly for simulation and models.
For computer science, it is in machine learning and computational techniques high-performance fast computing.
